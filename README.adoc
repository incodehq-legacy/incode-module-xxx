== How to run the Demo App


The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x or later is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/incodehq/isis-module-xxx.git
cd isis-module-xxx
mvn clean install
----


To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn -pl webapp -Dmavenmixin-jettywar jetty:run
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`



== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.communications</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-communications-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* in the `AppManifest`, update its `getModules()` method: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.incode.module.xxx.dom.XxxModuleDomModule.class,
    );
}
----



Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-xxx-dom[Maven Central Repo].


==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  
We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----






== Known issues

(none)


== Change Log


* `1.13.0` - released against Isis 1.13.2


== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `module-dom` - the module implementation itself
* `demo/module-dom` - demo app's supporting domain that uses `module-dom` in some way
* `demo/application` - demo app's app manifest and application-level integration tets
* `demo/webapp` - demo app's webapp, to create war and docker images


Only the `module-dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Note that the module uses link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok].  To compile the code within your IDE you will
therefore require the appropriate Lombok plugin.  See the link:https://projectlombok.org/download.html[Lombok download page] for more information.

==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release an Interim Build

If you have commit access to this project (or a fork of your own) then you can create interim releases using the `interim-release.sh` script.

The idea is that this will - in a new branch - update the `dom/pom.xml` with a timestamped version (eg `1.13.12.20161122-0740`).
It then pushes the branch (and a tag) to the specified remote.

A CI server such as Jenkins can monitor the branches matching the wildcard `origin/interim/*` and create a build.
These artifacts can then be published to a snapshot repository.

For example:

[source]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.13.0 origin
----

where

* `1.13.0` is the base release
* `origin` is the name of the remote to which you have permissions to write to.




=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.13.0 \
              1.14.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master && git push origin 1.13.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue before trying again.
Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the `autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).
You may want to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
